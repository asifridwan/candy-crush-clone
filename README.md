# CandyCrush Clone

This is a clone of the popular mobile game "CandyCrush" creating using the ReactJS library, which makes use of the "useState" and "useEffect" hooks

This works the same way as the original mobile game with a score board feature

Feel free to mess around with the code to see how I made it
